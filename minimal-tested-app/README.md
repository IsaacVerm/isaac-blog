# Minimal tested app

## Guides

[MDN Getting started with web development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web)

Why not enough:

- does not incorporate modern web practices
- too in depth

[https://www.learnenough.com/](https://www.learnenough.com/html)

Why not enough:

- by topic (HTML separate from CSS separate from HTML, ...)
- paying

Bootcamps:

- [freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)

Why not enough:

- small examples which do not cover the whole

## Philosophy

- just enough to be dangerous
- comprehensive
- driven by questions

## Goal

Lots of people have the need to quickly share some of their information in a way they like. Sadly enough, lots of people are not really familiar with a way to do this. 

Of the people who are not familiar with programming but still have the courage to give it a try lots of people give up because their app falls over.

I want to show:

- things aren't hard to learn
- you have to do things structured or they fall over
- it doesn't take a lot of time to make something decent
- making something is fun
- sharing what you make is fun

Showing it doesn't take a lot to build a functioning app that is decently tested. Since I have a QA background I'll put extra stress on the testing part.

Requirements:
- functioning app
- thoroughly tested

Functioning app:

- UI
- API

Decently tested

- E2E tests
- UI tests
- API tests
- continuous integration

What this tutorial doesn't teach:

- UX goes through the window
- security goes through the window

There's freedom in DIY.

Tutorial will follow [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web) as a guideline but will be different in some respects:

- in this tutorial I don't dwell too much on the inner workings of concepts. Just enough to be dangerous
- broder scope: complete overview of modern web development practices

So in a way this tutorial does less (goes less in depth) and in a way it does more (covers more concepts).

It's not because I don't mention something it doesn't exist. I just don't mention it as not to confuse. However, nothing in this tutorial is not true, it can just be very incomplete.

## Value of this contribution

Existing tutorials:

- [MDN: Getting started with the Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web)

I was inspired by these :

- for myself to freshen up concepts
- accessible introduction with questions
- start from absolute basics and improve
- integrated with modern best practices
  - testing
  - version control
  - automation system

E.g. MDN documentation doesn't mention testing.

Doesn't just introduce concepts, goes through the reasoning why they're needed and how things are related. Based on my own experiences.

[Other tutorials exist](https://meiert.com/en/blog/minimal-web-development/) but they often go already too much into detail (beginners don't care about ES6, ES7 or ES8 but just about making something work)

## First web application

### HTML

The Holy Trinity is HTML, Javascript and CSS but HTML is God. 

```

```



## First step

Starting from a blank page is always hard. Let's think about what we need. In web development there's something called the Holy Trinity of HTML, Javascript and CSS. HTML is the site itself, Javascript is used to modify that HTML and CSS makes everything prettier.

Most of the times I skip the CSS part. I made a few web apps and all of them have that most distinctive 90s look. I prefer to call that a serious look but I was told several times it's "butt ugly". De gustibus et colorbus. So for the sake of simplicity in this tutorial I will forsake the Holy Trinity (in the Middle Ages that would make me end up at the stake, in modern times you just get harassed by UX designers which is a far better fate) and stick to Duality.

The MDN documentation is a great resource for anything related to web.

## App

I was reading `Three Men in a Boat`, thoroughly liking it, and this book by Jerome K. Jerome contains lots of memorable quotes. So let's do humanity a service and make these quotes more readily available. 

You can ask up to 3 quotes but not more (too much is too much). If

## Testing

- ask for quote
  - you get quote text and author
- can't ask for more than 3 quotes
